# Grade 125/125

This is the first project in 42 common-core.

It was also a very challenging one (at least for me).

We've started to work on many functions that will give a hand on the future.

Functions that will help with memory allocation, strings, linked lists (bonus part) and so on.

Right now is also including the get_next_line and ft_Printf.

All the functions have some of the tests that I used.

Subject of the project included on repository.
